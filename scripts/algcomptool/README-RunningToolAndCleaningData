PREP WORK:
1) Place the two .csv files to be compared in the input folder
2) In the tool/AlgCompTool.py change the alg1 and alg2 locations to the correct names
	of the input files placed in step 1

ENSURE DATA IS CLEANED STEPS BELOW:

1) Ensure the input files have non-null values in titled columns 'sid','score','sub','class','oid','obj'
2) Ensure the input files have (subject)*(object) rows/samples
3) Ensure all values in the 'sub' column for both files have the exact same named entries
	(i.e. dbr:A_Beautiful_Mind_(film) in alg1 should be exactly the same name
	and not dbresource/:A_Beautiful_Mind_(film) or A_Beautiful_Mind)
4) Ensure the output/ folder is empty as files may get created there and should not
	be over-written

HOW TO RUN TOOL:
The tool will run in Python 3, and can be executed the following way from the command line:

python AlgCompTool.py
	-This prints the results to the terminal (not advised if the file is large)

python AlgCompTool.py -f or python AlgCompTool.py --file
	-This prints the comparison to files in the output/ folder, one file for the comparison of the two algorithms, another for the Algorithm1 confusion calculations in .csv format, and another for Algorithm2 confusion calculations in .csv format.
